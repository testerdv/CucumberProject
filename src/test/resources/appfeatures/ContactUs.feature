#8steps(6skipped,2 undefined) for without steps definitions
#https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/:
#When Cucumber canâ€™t find a matching step definition, the step gets marked as undefined (yellow), and all subsequent steps in the scenario are skipped.
#this is because Steps that follow undefined, pending, or failed steps are never executed, even 
#if there is a matching step definition. These steps are marked as skipped (cyan).
